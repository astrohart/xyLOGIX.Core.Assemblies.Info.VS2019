# xyLOGIX.Core.Assemblies.Info `class library`

.NET Frramework 4.8 class library project that provides objects and functionality for getting the attributes, e.g., Product, Title, Version etc of the calling assembly as strings.

## Introduction

Previously, when we'd, say, add an `AboutBox` component to our WinForms app, we'd get properties added to the **About** dialog box that is generated, such as `AssemblyProduct`, `AssemblyTitle` etc. that the dialog box would utilize in order to provide the user with information on the currently-running application.

This library provides those properties, but now, to anyone who wants them.
